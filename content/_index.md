# Welcome to My Portfolio ðŸ‘‹

Hi, Iâ€™m **Ajul T. M** â€” an aspiring **Computer Science and Engineering student** with a passion for **AI, problem-solving, and building impactful projects**.

I created this site as part of my **amFOSS recruitment tasks**, but more importantly, itâ€™s a space where I share my journey, work, and the resources that shaped me. My goal is not just to showcase what Iâ€™ve done, but to connect, learn, and grow along the way.

Hereâ€™s what youâ€™ll find on this site:

- **About Me** â€” Get to know my background, goals, and interests.  
- **Projects & Achievements** â€” Explore the projects Iâ€™m currently working on and milestones Iâ€™ve reached.  
- **Resources** â€” A curated collection of books, tutorials, and guides that I personally recommend.

Thanks for stopping by â€” I hope you find something here that inspires or helps you on your own journey ðŸš€
